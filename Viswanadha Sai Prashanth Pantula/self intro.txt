Good Morning Everyone,

My name is Viswanadha Sai Prashanth Pantula, and I am from Visakhapatnam. 
I completed my B.Tech from Avanthi Institute of Engineering and Technology in Visakhapatnam.
During my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in data analysis and machine learning, which led me to focus on Core Python, Python Libraries, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Supervised Machine Learning.

I consider myself highly adaptable to different work environments and I am always eager to learn and grow professionally. 
I enjoy taking on challenges that push me to improve my skills and broaden my knowledge.

Outside of academics and work, I have a passion for musicâ€”I enjoy singing, listening to, and producing music, which helps me stay creative and focused.

My long-term career goal is to build a successful career in Data Science by applying my skills to meaningful projects. 
In the short term, I am focused on deepening my knowledge in Data Science and gaining practical experience that will help me become a Data Scientist.

I am excited about opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow in this dynamic field.
